TOP Project: Admin Dashboard

Step 1: Set up and planning
    - Set up your HTML and CSS files with some simple dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
    - Set up your Git repository (refer to past projects if you need a refresher).
    - Download a full-resolution copy of the project design file and get a general idea for how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.



Step 2: Layout
    - Start by writing out the HTML elements for the sidebar, header and main-content containers.
    - In your CSS file, apply Grid properties until you have this basic layout built.



Step 3: Nesting
    - Taking it one section at a time, begin nesting child elements under the parent elements in the HTML. Remember that you can keep making grid containers within grid containers.
    - In the sidebar, use more grids to lay out the navigation and branding sections.
    - In the header, use more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons.
    - For the main-content, use more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items.
    - Fill out some dummy content and placeholder images so you can position all of your grid items.



Step 4: Gather assets
    - Once you have your grid layout complete you can either recreate the dashboard example above or style your own design.
    - Check out some color palettes from Tailwind.
    - All of the icons and more can be downloaded as SVGs from Material Design Icons.
    -   - Choose your own fonts! The design example uses Roboto, which is available with Google fonts.



Step 5: Some tips!
    - When building the layout, apply background colors or borders to your containers to help you visualize your grid.
    - It’s up to you whether to use pixels, fr units or both for your grid tracks.
    - This project does not have to be responsive, but if you’d like to you can expand or shrink the project cards section when resizing the browser window.
    - You don’t have to make a pixel perfect match with the design example. Consider this an opportunity to practice your CSS skills with your own designs.
    - Don’t forget to push your finished dashboard to GitHub. Use GitHub Pages to publish it to the world!
